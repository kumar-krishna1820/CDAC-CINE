image classification model

The code demonstrates to create, train, and test a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images into three categories: OSCC (Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma), Leukoplakia without dysplasia, and Leukoplakia with dysplasia.The process involves loading and preprocessing the image data, defining the CNN model architecture, training the model on the dataset, and finally evaluating its performance using test data.
